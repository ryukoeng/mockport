# Mockport Development Documentation Pack

Created: 2026-05-25

Mockport is a Docker-first service emulator for secret-free integration testing in AI-native development.

This documentation pack defines the initial product concept, MVP scope, Go implementation strategy, architecture, adapter model, CLI commands, Docker usage, security philosophy, and execution roadmap.

## Recommended stack

- Go: 1.26.3
- Docker Engine: 29.5.2
- Docker Compose: v5.x line
- Runtime distribution: Docker image first, Go binary second, optional npm wrapper later
- Repository model: single repository / monorepo for MVP

## First implementation target

The first implementation target is a Stripe-like adapter that can run in Docker and return payment success/failure responses without real Stripe secrets.

The goal is not to clone Stripe completely. The goal is to make common integration paths testable with fake local secrets and scenario-driven responses.
