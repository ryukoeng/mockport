# Compatibility Report

Generated: 2026-05-26

Compatibility is measured from Mockport runtime metadata, SDK/client contract checks, fixture coverage, and known gaps. It is not a claim that provider internals or undocumented behavior are reproduced.

## Scores

| Adapter | Maturity | Score | Provider API | SDK/client evidence |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `github-oauth` | `workflow-compatible` | 80 | 2022-11-28 | client contract |
| `openai` | `workflow-compatible` | 100 | 2025-02-01 | openai@6.39.0 |
| `slack` | `workflow-compatible` | 80 | 2025-02-01 | client contract |
| `stripe` | `workflow-compatible` | 100 | 2025-10-29.clover | stripe@22.1.1 |

## Coverage

| Adapter | Endpoint | Scenario | SDK/client | State | Error |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `github-oauth` | 100 | 100 | 0 | 100 | 100 |
| `openai` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `slack` | 100 | 100 | 0 | 100 | 100 |
| `stripe` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

## Known Gaps

### github-oauth
- No real GitHub policy, repository permissions, SSO, org/enterprise enforcement, or app installation model.

### openai
- No real model quality, tokenization parity, hosted tools, vector stores, or provider scheduling.

### slack
- No real delivery, Events API completeness, Block Kit validation, files, app scopes, enterprise policy, or full workspace directory.

### stripe
- No fraud, payment network, tax, disputes, Connect, or full Billing lifecycle.

## Release Labels

- `experimental`: Early adapter coverage for selected workflows. Expect gaps.
- `sdk-compatible`: Selected SDK or client contract calls pass against local Mockport.
- `workflow-compatible`: Selected workflows include fake state, errors, and replayable behavior.
- `provider-compatible`: Selected provider workflows are backed by manifests, SDK contracts, fixtures, scores, and known-gap reports.
